            <p>My traditional education finished shortly after my GCSE's. From there I went at it alone, teaching myself web design and development skills and working on various small business ideas.</p>

            <p>I was resident DJ at a club in Oxford for two years, spinning tunes 3 or 4 nights a week.</p>
            <p>I also ran a promotions company and organised around 100 successful shows in Oxford, some up to 1,500 capacity. We booked some major rap stars, from acts such as Jurassic 5 and Blackalicious, as well as giving locals a platform to perform. I produced all branding (print and digital) and built a site, where there is still a list of events: <a href="http://wordplayuk.co.uk/events" target="_blank">Wordplay</a>.</p>

            <p>My skillset of frontend development, design and Drupal development allowed me to take on several freelance contracts with companies such as <a href="http://torchbox.com" target="_blank">Torchbox</a>, <a href="http://brightlemon.com/" target="_blank">BrightLemon</a> and <a href="http://www.cameronandwilding.com/" target="_blank">Cameron & Wilding</a>. I worked on some high profile projects, such as <a href="http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/" target="_blank">Nuffield Trust</a> (Frontend dev),

          <div>
            <p>In 2012 I co-founded <a href="http://agilecollective.com" target="_blank">Agile Collective</a> a co-operative web development company, achievements include: successfully launching the business and helping take it to stability; winning and managing sizeable (around Â£50k) multi-stakeholder projects with high profile clients such as <a href="http://mtv.ru" target="_blank">MTV</a>, <a href="http://buysocialdirectory.org.uk" target="_blank">Cabinet Office and City of London.</a></p>
            <p>I've worked on a wide variety of projects and on the business using an ever increasing skillset, such as <a href="https://myhaccp.food.gov.uk/" target="_blank">MyHACCP</a> (frontend dev), <a href="http://community.ja.net" target="_blank">Community.ja.net</a> (project management / full stack dev). From networking to stragey and marketing through frontend, backend and sysadmin tasks I've fully immersed myself in the business. Now though, it's time for a new challenge.</p>

          <div>
            <p>After being part of the Drupal community for a few years and attending several conferences I was called on to be part of the organising committee for the inaugural DrupalCamp London in 2013, I built <a href="http://2013.drupalcamplondon.co.uk/" target="_blank">the site</a> for 2013 and organised the parties for 2014, as well as helping with general organisation and decision making. The conference attracted 500+ people and ran to huge success (and to a profit).</p>

          <div>
            <p>I've pioneered an initiative to help young people start a career in web development. Through <a href="http://opendrupal.org" target="_blank">Open Drupal</a> I've designed an open source curriculum and helped set up an <a href="http://apprenticeships.opendrupal.org/" target="_blank">apprenticeship programme</a> which has seen six young people gain employment in London.</p>
